                          the faint cries girls are heard-cries that do not come from their hearts but from
                          the depth of their despair. I am Suman , a girl from this tormented land.
                          Once not long ago, I was in 7th grade, dreaming of becoming a doctor, going to 
                          school with hope but everything changed with the arrival of Taliban. We, the girls
                          of Kabul, now must study in hiding. With fear and trembling hands, yet with
                          unwavering determination. Girls who wanted to fly, but their wings were broken.
                          There was a time when I went to school with si much love and excitement. A time when 
                          I studied with passion, always scored high marks, and dreamed of one day studying at 
                          a university in London.
                          I wanted to be a voice for the silenced voices of other Afghan
                          girls. I dreamed of becoming a heart surgeon and working in a hospital in London,
                          fulfilling all my ambitions.
                          But everything changed. My dreams became unreachable. I could not reach the future I
                          had once envisioned. I never thought a day would come when I would have to attend a
                          secret school. A hidden school in one of Kabul's back alleys, with almost resources,
                          filled with fear and anxiety. Now, I attend classes wearing full

                            back clothes, 
                          gloves and mask. Even in this unbearable summer heat. Sometimes I ask my self “ 
                          when I grow older but remain uneducated, what then? For a 17 years old girl living
                          in Afghanistan thinking about future feels strange. In many countries, girls are 
                          still considered children at 18 but here I am at 17, sewing clothes for others just
                          to cover my own expenses.
                          Wish one day reach to my dream of studying in London. But we do not have the financial
                           means to study abroad. Everyday, when I secretly go to school, I walk with a heart full
                            of fear- fearing that the Taliban might question my clothing or confront me for my 
                            appearance. I have personally witnessed girls being taken by the Taliban in public 
                            markets simply for how they dressed. They were arrested and disappeared l. To this 
                            day, no one know what happened to them</p>

                    <p class="" style="color: black; font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;">In the corner of a modest home, 
                        on a worn-out carpet, two little girls sit.
                        One holds a pencil between her tiny fingers, carefully drawing a small- happy
                         looking mouse on paper- a mouse with bright eyes, so unlike her own, which hide 
                         a deep sadness behind a child’s faint smile.
                        The other, a bit further away, has placed a small phone beside her own, 
                        with indescribable passion, tries to bring a cartoon character to life on paper.
                        Each line she draw is like a silent scream- a cry for the world that has been denied to her.
                        These girls are artists, but high walks block their flight.
                        They have dreams, but the dark shadow of oppression has fallen over them.
                        Their schools are shut down, their books gather dust, and even the right to breathe
                        freely has been stripped away.
                        In the streets of their city, fear wanders-fear with a name: <strong>Taliban</strong>

                          Yet, inside this small room, pencils and paper create miracles.
                          Every line is an act of defiance; every drawing ,a rebellion against the darkness.
                          When the little girls draws her playful mouse, she whispers in her heart,
                          <strong>"One day, I will be free, and I will draw for the hole world.“</strong>
                          And the other sketching her cartoon figure, silently vows:
                          <strong>"One day, I will be somewhere no one can imprison my dreams."</strong>
                          The Taliban can lock the doors, but they cannot silence dreams.
                          With every pencil, every line, every color, they imagine,
                          these girls are greeting a future. <strong>A future that may come late. But it will come.</strong>

                        Zuhal was 16 years old. In the dusty alleys of Kabul, she lived in a small,
                        worn-down house with her mother and two younger sisters. Her father had been
                        killed years earlier by a roadside mine explosion. All that reminded of him was
                        a black-and-white photo in a broken wooden frame above the shelf. Zuhal was an 
                        intelligent, book-loving girl passionate about writing and dreaming of becoming 
                        an author. Before the Taliban returned, she went to school , participated in essay 
                        competition and dreamed of one day becoming a voice for the silenced women of her 
                        homeland. But the world changed. Suddenly, school gates were locked, a curtain of 
                        fear fell across the city, and Zuhal's dreams were buried beneath the dark veils 
                        that were now forced onto her. One day, the scorched the streets of Kabul. Zuhal 
                        stepped out of her house to get medicine for her sick mother. She wore a long grey 
                        chador, but her face was not fully covered. Her steps were slow but her heart beat 
                        anxiously. The pharmacy was only two alleys away. On her way back, the rumble of a 
                        black vehicle echoed through the narrowstreet. Two men in Taliban uniforms got out.

                                  One of them shouted:
                                  <strong>“Shameless girl! Why is your face uncovered?”</strong>
                                  Zuhal tried to speak but her voice got caught in her throat. 
                                  The other man grabbed her harshly by the arm. People watched. Some turned away. 
                                  But no one said anything. They forced her into the car and took her away. 
                                  They confiscated her phone number and blindfolded her. For hours, they interrogated 
                                  her in a dark room. They accused her of violating “Sharia" , warning her that if she 
                                  was ever seen again without full hajab, her punishment would be harsher. They humiliated 
                                  her, insulted her and she cried. No out of fear, but out of rage, out of a
                                  stifled scream, out of helplessness. Late that night, they released her quietly.

                    home, her mother opened
                    the door with tearful eyes. Her sister embraced her. 
                    <strong><i>But Zuhal was no longer the same girl.</i></strong>
                    Her voice trembled, her gaze dimmed and her heart was filled with a silent fear. 
                    The next morning she opened her old notebook and write:
                    <strong>“ They may have thrown a chador over my head, They may have silenced my voice, 
                    They may have tried to break me, But they don’t know that my mind is still free 
                    that I can fight back with words. I am alive, and as long as I live, 
                    I will write our story.”</strong>

                    Her name is<strong> Zahra</strong>, a fifteen years old girl from Herat.
                    She used to wake up every morning with the sound of birds outside her window, 
                    put on her school uniform and run to class with a smile. She dreamed of becoming 
                    a teacher, so that one day she could light the path of knowledge for other girls.
                    But one morning, her world collapsed.
                    The gates of her school were locked. The blackboards were erased. Her books, once full 
                    of hope, were left abandoned in the corner of her room. From that day on, Zahra’s life 
                    turned into silence. No more laughter with her classmates. No running through the 
                    school yard. Instead, she sat by the window, watching the boys walk to school while 
                    she clutched her books against her chest, tears falling silently down her face.</p>

                    Her father told her:
                    <strong>"Daughter, the world has become too cruel for your dreams."</strong>
                    Bur Zahra refused to let her dreams die. At night, under the dim light of a lantern
                    , she would read the same pages over and over again, as of to keep her hope alive.
                    Her mother often found her crying over her notebooks, whispering:
                    <strong>"Why was I born a girl in a land where my wings must be broken?"</strong>
                    Now, Zahra’s voice cannot be heard in her own country. But if you listen closely, 
                    her silent cry, travels beyond the mountains of Afghanistan. It is the cry of thousands 
                    Afghan girls who gave robbed of their childhood, their education and future.
                    <strong>They are not asking for pity, They are asking for justice,

                        Nala was only eighteen. But her eyes, tired and heavy, carried the sorrow of 
                        a woman thrice her age. She leaved in West Kabul- a district where, over the 
                        few days, dozens of young girls have been arrested by the Taliban’s morality 
                        police, dragged from shopping centers, cafés, and busy streets- accused only of 
                        “bad hajab”. Many of them vanished into detention, their families left with no 
                        answers, just silence.
                        One afternoon, the sun blazed over the cracked concrete of Kabul. Nala, coveted in a 
                        black Chador and face mask, walked with a friend through a crowded market. Her hair 
                        was fully tucked away, her body hidden under layers, but it was not enough. A few 
                        strands of hair accidentally poked from the edge of her scarf. And that was enough.
                        A white van screeched to a halt. Two Taliban agents steeped out:
                        “you, Girl! Why is your hair showing? Are you trying to case fitna? One of them baked. 
                        Nala froze. Her friend trembled. The men did not wait for an answer. One grabbed Nala's 
                        wrist violently, the other pushed her toward the van. Passerby stood frozen. Some 
                        averted their eyes. Others sighed. No one intervened.</p>

                        The fear was too loud. Inside 
                        the van, the air was thick with silence. Nala’s heart pounded in her chest. She did not 
                        know where they were going- no one did. That was the horror.
                        They took her to unknown location- cold grey, Nameless. Interrogation began. 
                        <strong>“Why was your scarf too loose? Why did you came out without a male guardian?" </strong>
                        They humiliate her, called her immoral, accused her of endangering society. She was 
                        made to sign a statement swearing she would never again “violate Sharia” . Some girls 
                        were released after their families paid money. Some were not released at all.When 
                        Nala finally returned home late that night, she did not cry in front of anyone. But 
                        her smile was gone. Her laughter had vanished. She sat in silence, her schoolbooks 
                        gathering dust in the corner. She did not touch her math notes. She did not look 
                        outside the window for days. But one night, while everyone was asleep, she pulled an 
                        old notebook. From. Beneath her pillow. The paper was yellowed, the pen nearly dry. 
                        She Wrote:
                        <strong>Maybe they found fault with my scarf, Maybe they judged my mask to be imperfect
                        , Maybe they saw me as a threat, But they don’t know , my mind is still free, My voice 
                        is still alive in my heart. I am Nala, And you, you are my witness, As long as words can 
                        build bridges between silence and truth, I will write. I will tell our story.</strong>
